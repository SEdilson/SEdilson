## Hello, I'm Edilson.

I'm a backend developer currently building things mostly with JS/TS using Node.js, also I'm passionate about DevOps, Cloud Computing and trying to build robots (:robot:). The open source community is one of the things that I like the most on being a developer, because of all these people that help each other whenever necessary is one of the reasons I could learn a lot, despite being on the early steps of my career, this fuels me to learn even more and to keep growing as a software enginneer. :smile:
